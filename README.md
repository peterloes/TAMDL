Platform for animal observation and manipulation. 

An efficient system to monitor animal behaviour in wildlife
as well as in laboratory settings.

-	Compatible with different RFID systems and triggers
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection lead to long lasting collection periods
-	Applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	High observation quality through low disturbance of the animals
- Three user-defined power outputs that can individually be switched on or off at user-defined times

- Time Synchronization with atomic clock once a day to ensure optimal data quality
- Current Control twice a day
- Forecast for Battery-Change implemented
- Energy Bypass so that Date and Time are maintained even when changing battery
- Hyperterminal Output, to get real-time data to the computer/laptop
- Low-Power Device 
- Measure Voltage and Current from your triggered devices

C is the Greenest Programming Language

To achieve its power and energy-efficiency features, EFM32 products utilize ultralow active and idle power,
fast wakeup and processing times, and most important, the ability to intelligently interact with peripherals
and sensors autonomously without waking up the CPU and consuming more power.
